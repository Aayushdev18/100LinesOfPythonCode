# Console Wordle
## Introduction
This is a watered-down Wordle clone for your terminal. I ***might*** make a better one soon.
## Requirements
Install `colorama` via `python -m pip install colorama`
## Add custom dictionary
1. Remove `dictionary.txt` and create it again
*  Edit file instead if you want
3. Add words separated by newlines
4. You're done!
