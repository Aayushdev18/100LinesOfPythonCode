#  Quick Reminder Script

A simple **Python command-line reminder tool** that waits for a specified amount of time before displaying a reminder message.
Ideal for quick breaks, short tasks, or time-based alerts during work or study sessions.

---

##  Features

*  Set a **custom reminder message**
*  Specify the **delay time (in seconds)**
*  Displays a **reminder notification** after the wait time
*  Uses built-in Python `time` module (no external dependencies)

---

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a reminder message.
2. The user enters the number of seconds to wait.
3. The program pauses using `time.sleep()`.
4. After the delay, it prints the reminder message and a motivational message.
