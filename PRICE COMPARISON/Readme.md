# Grocery Price Comparison Tool

This is a simple **Python program** that compares prices of grocery items across different stores and finds the store offering the best price for a given item.

## Features

- Add multiple stores with different pricing.
- Compare prices of items across the stores.
- Find the best price for an item.

## How It Works

1. The program defines a `Store` class that holds item prices.
2. A `PriceComparison` class is used to store multiple stores and compare item prices.
3. The `main()` function:
   - Creates store objects.
   - Adds item prices to each store.
   - Finds the best price for a given item.

## Code Structure

- `Store` class: Stores prices of items.
- `PriceComparison` class: Compares prices across multiple stores.
- `main()`: Initializes stores, adds item prices, and finds the best price.

## Prerequisites

- Install Python (3.x recommended)
- A text editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**
