# ðŸŒ± Virtual Tree Planter (Simple Version)

This is a simple Python script that lets you plant virtual trees!  
Each time you run it, it adds one tree to your total and saves progress.

### ðŸ’¡ How It Works
- The total number of trees is stored in a file named `tree_data.txt`.
- Every time you run the script, it adds one to your count.
- You can set your own goal by editing the `GOAL` variable in the script.
