# Cursor Movement Inverter
This Python script inverts your mouse movements â€” moving your cursor up will make it go down, and vice versa.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pyautogui
- pynput

## How it Works
The script listens for your mouse movements and instantly moves your cursor to the inverted position using screen coordinates.

## Disclaimer
This script may cause your cursor to behave unexpectedly.  
Press 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal to stop it.
