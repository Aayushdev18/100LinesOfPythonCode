Streamlit Chatbot Interface
This project is a simple chatbot interface built using Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT model (specifically GPT-3.5 Turbo). It features chat history persistence using Shelve for local storage, and allows users to reset the chat history via a sidebar button.

Features
Interactive Chat Interface: Users can input queries and receive responses from the OpenAI GPT model in real time.
Persistent Chat History: Conversations are saved locally using shelve, ensuring chat history is maintained across sessions.
Chat Reset: Users can reset/delete their chat history with a button in the sidebar.
Model Customization: You can specify which OpenAI model to use for completions (default is gpt-3.5-turbo).
Technologies Used
Streamlit: For creating the web-based user interface.
OpenAI API: For handling AI-based conversation responses.
Shelve: For local persistence of chat history.
dotenv: To securely load API keys from environment variables.
