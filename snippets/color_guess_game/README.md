# Color Guess Game ðŸŽ¨

An interactive command-line game where players guess color names based on their RGB values.

## Description

The Color Guess Game challenges players to identify colors from their RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. The game provides hints based on the RGB composition and tracks your score throughout multiple rounds.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **15 Different Colors**: Includes common colors like red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and more
- ðŸ’¡ **Smart Hints**: Provides helpful hints based on RGB value patterns
- ðŸ“Š **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of your correct guesses and overall accuracy
- âœ… **Instant Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on whether your guess was correct
- ðŸŽ® **Multiple Rounds**: Play as many rounds as you like

## How to Play

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python color_guess_game.py
   ```

2. The game will display RGB values (e.g., RGB: (255, 0, 0))

3. You'll receive a hint about the color composition

4. Type your guess (e.g., "red", "blue", "green")

5. Get instant feedback on your answer

6. Choose to play another round or quit
