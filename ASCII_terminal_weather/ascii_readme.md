# Explanation of the Weather Application Code

This Python script fetches and displays weather information for a user-specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides a visually engaging console-based interface with ASCII art, a temperature evolution simulation, and weather forecasts. Below is a detailed breakdown of what the code does.

## Overview
The script performs the following main tasks:
1. Retrieves current weather data for a specified city.
2. Displays the weather information with ASCII art and a temperature bar.
3. Simulates temperature evolution across multiple zones using a differential equation.
4. Provides tomorrow’s and 5-day weather forecasts.
5. Animates the display in the console for an interactive experience.

## Dependencies
The script uses the following Python libraries:
- `os`: For system operations like clearing the console.
- `time`: For handling delays in the animation.
- `argparse`: To parse command-line arguments (city name).
- `pyfiglet`: To generate ASCII art for the city name.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations in the temperature simulation.
- `colorama`: For colored terminal output.
- `requests`: To make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

The `colorama` library is initialized with `init(autoreset=True)` to automatically reset text colors after each print.

## API Configuration
- **API Key**: Uses a hardcoded OpenWeatherMap API key .
- **Base URL**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather` for current weather data.
- **Forecast URL**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast` for forecast data.

## Weather ASCII Art
A dictionary (`WEATHER_ART`) maps weather conditions (e.g., "Clear", "Clouds", "Rain", "Snow", "Thunderstorm", "Mist") to ASCII art representations. Each includes an emoji (e.g., ☀️ for Clear) and a simple stick figure. A `default` art is used for unrecognized conditions.

## Key Functions

### `get_weather(city)`
- **Purpose**: Fetches current weather data for the specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Process**:
  - Sends an HTTP GET request to the base URL with the city name, API key, and metric units (Celsius).
  - Extracts and returns a dictionary with:
    - `temp`: Current temperature (°C).
    - `feels_like`: Perceived temperature (°C).
    - `humidity`: Humidity percentage.
    - `pressure`: Atmospheric pressure (hPa).
    - `cond`: Main weather condition (e.g., "Clear").
    - `desc`: Capitalized weather description.
    - `city`: City name.
    - `country`: Country code.
  - Handles errors by printing a red-colored error message and returning `None`.

### `get_forecast(city)`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves weather forecasts for tomorrow and the next 5 days.
- **Process**:
  - Sends an HTTP GET request to the forecast URL.
  - **Tomorrow’s Forecast**: Finds the first forecast entry ~24 hours from the current time and extracts its temperature and condition.
  - **5-Day Forecast**: Collects forecasts for 12:00 (noon) each day, up to 5 days, storing temperature and condition in a dictionary.
  - Returns a tuple: `(tomorrow_temp, tomorrow_cond, daily_forecast)`.
  - Handles errors by printing a red-colored error message and returning `(None, None, None)`.

### `evolve_temp_matrix(T0, T_env, k=0.03, dt=0.2, steps=40, zones=5)`
- **Purpose**: Simulates temperature evolution across multiple zones using the differential equation `dT/dt = -k(T - T_env)`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `T0`: Initial temperature (from weather data).
  - `T_env`: Environmental temperature (set based on current temperature).
  - `k`: Cooling/heating rate constant (default: 0.03).
  - `dt`: Time step (default: 0.2).
  - `steps`: Number of time steps (default: 40).
  - `zones`: Number of spatial zones (default: 5).
- **Process**:
  - Creates a NumPy array (matrix) with `steps+1` rows and `zones` columns, initialized with `T0`.
  - Iteratively updates temperatures using the differential equation to model convergence toward `T_env`.
  - Returns the temperature matrix.

### `temp_bar(temp, min_t=-10, max_t=40, width=40)`
- **Purpose**: Generates an ASCII bar to visually represent temperature.
- **Process**:
  - Scales the temperature within a range (`min_t` to `max_t`) to calculate a ratio.
  - Creates a bar with "█" for filled segments and "-" for empty ones, based on the ratio.
  - Returns the ASCII bar as a string.

### `animate_weather(data, zones=5)`
- **Purpose**: Displays an animated visualization of weather data.
- **Process**:
  - Extracts weather data (temperature, condition, etc.) from the input dictionary.
  - Sets an environmental temperature (`T_env`) to `temp - 5` if `temp > 15`, else `temp + 5`.
  - Runs `evolve_temp_matrix` to simulate temperature changes.
  - For each simulation step:
    - Clears the console (using `cls` for Windows or `clear` for Unix).
    - Displays the city and country in ASCII art (using `pyfiglet`, colored cyan).
    - Shows the corresponding weather ASCII art.
    - Prints weather details: condition, average temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, and pressure.
    - Displays a temperature bar using `temp_bar`.
    - Shows the differential equation and simulation status (step number and zones).
    - Pauses for 0.08 seconds to create an animation effect.
  - Prints "Simulation complete " when finished.

### `main()`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the program’s execution.
- **Process**:
  - Parses the city name from command-line arguments using `argparse`.
  - Calls `get_weather` to fetch current weather data.
  - If data is retrieved:
    - Runs `animate_weather` to display the animated visualization.
    - Calls `get_forecast` to retrieve tomorrow’s and 5-day forecasts.
    - Prints tomorrow’s forecast (temperature and condition) if available.
    - Prints the 5-day forecast (date, temperature, condition) if available.

## Program Execution
- The script checks `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure `main()` runs only when the script is executed directly.
- Users run the script from the command line, providing a city name (e.g., `python script.py London`).

## Output
- **Current Weather**: Displayed as an animation with:
  - ASCII art for the city name and weather condition.
  - Weather details (temperature, feels-like, humidity, pressure).
  - A dynamic temperature bar.
  - Simulation status showing the differential equation and progress.
- **Forecasts**:
  - Tomorrow’s temperature and condition.
  - 5-day forecast with daily noon temperatures and conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Errors (e.g., invalid city or API failure) are displayed in red using `colorama`.

## Summary
This script combines real-time weather data retrieval with an interactive console-based visualization. It uses ASCII art for aesthetic appeal, simulates temperature dynamics with a mathematical model, and provides both current and forecasted weather information. The animation, powered by iterative console updates, makes the output engaging, while `colorama` enhances readability with colored text.

## Requirements
Python 3.x and the following packages:
- numpy
- pyfiglet
- colorama
- requests

## Usage
```bash
python ascii_weather.py <city-name>
