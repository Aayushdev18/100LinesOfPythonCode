## Code Explanation

The program uses the following components:

1. **Imports and Initialization**:
   - `random` for selecting random items.
   - `colorama` for color formatting in the command-line output. The `init(autoreset=True)` function ensures that styles reset automatically after each print statement, making it platform-compatible.

2. **Data**:
   - Three lists (`appetizers`, `main_courses`, and `desserts`) store different meal options. These lists can be easily extended to add more choices.

3. **`pick_meal()` Function**:
   - A simple function that randomly picks an item from each list and returns the selected items as a tuple.

4. **Displaying the Output**:
   - The program prints each part of the meal (appetizer, main course, dessert) with labels and colors for a more engaging experience.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the lists in the code to include your favorite dishes or additional meal options. Simply add more strings to the `appetizers`, `main_courses`, and `desserts` lists to personalize the tool.

Example:
```python
# Adding items to the main_courses list
main_courses = ["Spaghetti Bolognese", "Grilled Chicken", "Vegetable Stir Fry", "Sushi", "Fried Rice", "Paneer Tikka"]
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Color Not Displaying**:
   - Make sure the `colorama` library is installed. You can check by running:
     ```bash
     pip show colorama
     ```
   - If the problem persists, try using a different terminal or command-line tool.

2. **Adding More Items**:
   - Ensure each item is a string and separated by a comma in the list.
