# Daily Reflection Prompts

## Description
A Python script that provides daily reflection prompts for self-reflection and personal growth.

## Features
- 40 diverse reflection prompts covering various aspects of life
- Displays a random journaling question each day
- Saves reflection history with timestamps
- View past reflections (last 7 days)
- JSON-based persistent storage
- User-friendly command-line interface

## Usage
```bash
python daily_reflection_prompts.py
```

## How It Works
1. Run the script to receive your daily reflection prompt
2. Optionally write your reflection (or skip)
3. Your responses are saved in `reflection_history.json`
4. View past reflections anytime by running the script again

## Example Prompts
- What are three things you're grateful for today?
- What did you learn about yourself today?
- How did you show kindness to yourself or others today?
- What would make tomorrow better than today?

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)

## File Structure
- `daily_reflection_prompts.py` - Main script (100 lines)
- `reflection_history.json` - Auto-generated file for storing reflections
