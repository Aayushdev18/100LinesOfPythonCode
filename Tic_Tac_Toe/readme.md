# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. Two players take turns to play, and the game will display the winner or declare a tie if all spots on the board are filled.

## How to Play

- Players take turns entering their moves.
- The board has three rows and three columns, and each move is made by entering the row and column number (1, 2, or 3) where you want to place your mark (`X` or `O`).
- The game checks if a player has won by filling a row, column, or diagonal with their mark.
- If all the spots on the board are filled and no player has won, the game declares a tie.
