# How to Contribute
Please first discuss the change you wish to make via [issue](https://github.com/sumanth-0/100LinesOfPythonCode/issues), with the maintainers of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process--
Create an issue and fork the repository, add a new folder with a name that describes your script in short. You'll place your Python script(s) in there.
Add a README.md in that file which explains your script and any prerequisites it may have.
Mention the issue you made in 1) in your Pull Request, which will be then verified and merged accordingly.
Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

1. Fork the Repository
Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of this page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine with the following command:

bash/Terminal

git clone https://github.com/sumanth-0/100LinesOfPythonCode.git

3. Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contribution:

bash/Terminal
Copy code
git checkout -b branch-name
Replace branch-name with something descriptive, like add-python-snippet or fix-typo-in-docs.

4. Add Your Python Code
Add your Python code snippet in the snippets/ directory. Ensure your code follows these guidelines:

It must be under 100 lines of code.
It should be well-commented and easy to understand.
It should provide something interesting—this could be a unique algorithm, a cool use case, or a clever trick in Python.
Name your file using a descriptive title of what the code does. For example:

bash
Copy code
snippets/fibonacci_sequence.py

5. Test Your Code
Ensure your code works by running it locally. If you can, write test cases to validate its functionality.

6. Commit and Push Your Changes
After you've made your changes and tested your code, commit your work:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add <description-of-your-code>"
git push origin branch-name

7. Open a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and click the "Compare & pull request" button. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they are interesting. You may reference issues or discussions if necessary.

8. Review and Merge
We will review your pull request, and once approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
