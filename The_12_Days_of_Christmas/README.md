# 12 Days of Christmas

The code inside the [solution.py](./solution.py) file contains one of the many ways to complete the "12 Days of Christmas" Code Golf challenge. \
In addition to the solution, it also includes an uncompressed and explained version of the algorithm used to reach the Top 100 table on https://code.golf (Bytes and Char, at Python topic).

The challenge consists of writing the following text with as few characters as possible:

The "12 Days of Christmas" refers to the song printed above. \
And "Code Golf" is the technique of achieving a result with as few characters/bytes as possible.

You can solve this problem using any strategy and programming language you want. \
I use Python to tackle these challenges because it's the language I use it almost every day, the one I know best, and also the one I enjoy the most. \
Depending on the challenge provider, you will find more flexibility or more rules. \
For example, at https://code.golf you cannot import any `zlib` or `base64` standard libraries.

Taking on this kind of challenge is a lot of fun; it really gets you thinking. And if there's one area where AI can't beat you, it's in this kind of terrain.
